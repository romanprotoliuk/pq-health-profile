Although humans can get infected with this parasite, they cannot complete the infected stage or grow. People cannot get infected by ingesting eggs, which are shed into the water by the shedding. If the meat of an intermediate host, such as chicken, is undercooked and it happens to be contaminated with the spargana larvae, the person can ingest it. A way to determine if an animal is infected with a type of tapeworm is to see white segments or faeces in the faeces."
